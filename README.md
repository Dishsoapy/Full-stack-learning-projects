# Full-stack-learning-projects
# This Repository contains all the small projects I have wrote while learning the basic groundwork of full-stack developement
# with a focus on front-end UI/UX learning. Subject to change.
# Why bother making this a repository?
# - To keep track of my progress
# - To use as reference for future projects in case I need to brush up on the basics
# - Keep all my projects online so it's not just stored locally (I like building new PC's and almost never transfer unimportan files teehee
# - Github is free, and I refuse to pay for anymore one-drive space, or Google, really most cloud services. The economy is expensive friends.
